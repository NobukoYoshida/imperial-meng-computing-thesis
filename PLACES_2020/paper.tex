% Problem: similar to PureScript paper

% In this paper, we present...

% TypeScript
% - gradual type system, superset of JavaScript
% - we define how our approach achieves "gradual linearity" (can we define this?)
Our work targets TypeScript - a superset of \dots

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a web-based game of \textit{Noughts and Crosses} where communication is performed through WebSocket connections.

% TicTacToe example - backend

% TicTacToe example - frontend

\section{Related work}
% New languages written  (e.g. ATS)
%	- addresses the challenge of resource linearity with a liner type system
%	- problem with webdev: not compatible with libraries, technologies, flexibility of JavaScript (ultimately the language of the browser)

% API generation
% - original Python implementation, generating monitors (Rumi's paper)
%	- Gradual type system lets us do better than just dynamic runtime checks
%	- could do the same approach with generating JavaScript monitors, but we have TS and Dart and can leverage more powerful type systems to do more static/compiler checks

% - Java (hybrid approach)
%	- leverage strongly typed system for static behavioural typing
%	- minimse dupliction by defining states in terms of IO interfaces (same IO state with different successor can still share code)
%	- runtime linearity checks

% Typestates (Mungo)
% - the React components we generate is essentially behaving like typestates of the role, where 
% each role has its set of permitted actions.

% Session types in web development
% - purescript looking at the whole workflow
	% - problem: PureScript isn't as prevalent
% - simon fowler paper on MVU targeting linearity for frontend GUI 

\section{Conclusion and Future work}

% Future work
% - generalise to encode protocols as typestates (e.g. Mungo example)
% - WebRTC for full MPST (since current limitation is w.r.t. MPST protocols with 1-server many-client roles

The optional arguments of {\tt $\backslash$documentclass$\{$eptcs$\}$} are
\begin{itemize}
\item at most one of
{\tt adraft},
{\tt submission} or
{\tt preliminary},
\item at most one of {\tt publicdomain} or {\tt copyright},
\item and optionally {\tt creativecommons},
  \begin{itemize}
  \item possibly augmented with
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt noderivs}
    \item or {\tt sharealike},
    \end{itemize}
  \item and possibly augmented with {\tt noncommercial}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
We use {\tt adraft} rather than {\tt draft} so as not to confuse hyperref.
The style-file option {\tt submission} is for papers that are
submitted to {\tt $\backslash$event}, where the value of the latter is
to be filled in in line 2 of the tex-file. Use {\tt preliminary} only
for papers that are accepted but not yet published. The final version
of your paper that is to be uploaded at the EPTCS website should have
none of these style-file options.

By means of the style-file option
\href{http://creativecommons.org/about/license/}{creativecommons}
authors equip their paper with a Creative Commons license that allows
everyone to copy, distribute, display, and perform their copyrighted
work and derivative works based upon it, but only if they give credit
the way you request. By invoking the additional style-file option {\tt
noderivs} you let others copy, distribute, display, and perform only
verbatim copies of your work, but not derivative works based upon
it. Alternatively, the {\tt sharealike} option allows others to
distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the
license that governs your work. Finally, you can invoke the option
{\tt noncommercial} that let others copy, distribute, display, and
perform your work and derivative works based upon it for
noncommercial purposes only.

Authors' (multiple) affiliations and emails use the commands
{\tt $\backslash$institute} and {\tt $\backslash$email}.
Both are optional.
Authors should moreover supply
{\tt $\backslash$titlerunning} and {\tt $\backslash$authorrunning},
and in case the copyrightholders are not the authors also
{\tt $\backslash$copyrightholders}.
As illustrated above, heuristic solutions may be called for to share
affiliations. Authors may apply their own creativity here.

\section{Prefaces}

Volume editors may create prefaces using this very template,
with {\tt $\backslash$title$\{$Preface$\}$} and {\tt $\backslash$author$\{\}$}.

\section{Bibliography}

We request that you use
\href{http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~rvg/EPTCS/eptcs.bst}
{\tt $\backslash$bibliographystyle$\{$eptcs$\}$}
\cite{bibliographystylewebpage}. Compared to the original {\LaTeX}
{\tt $\backslash$biblio\-graphystyle$\{$plain$\}$},
it ignores the field {\tt month}, and uses the extra
bibtex fields {\tt eid}, {\tt doi}, {\tt ee} and {\tt url}.
The first is for electronic identifiers (typically the number $n$
indicating the $n^{\rm th}$ paper in an issue) of papers in electronic
journals that do not use page numbers. The other three are to refer,
with life links, to electronic incarnations of the paper.

Almost all publishers use digital object identifiers (DOIs) as a
persistent way to locate electronic publications. Prefixing the DOI of
any paper with {\tt http://dx.doi.org/} yields a URI that resolves to the
current location (URL) of the response page\footnote{Nowadays, papers
  that are published electronically tend
  to have a \emph{response page} that lists the title, authors and
  abstract of the paper, and links to the actual manifestations of
  the paper (e.g.\ as {\tt dvi}- or {\tt pdf}-file). Sometimes
  publishers charge money to access the paper itself, but the response
  page is always freely available.}
of that paper. When the location of the response page changes (for
instance through a merge of publishers), the DOI of the paper remains
the same and (through an update by the publisher) the corresponding
URI will then resolve to the new location. For that reason a reference
ought to contain the DOI of a paper, with a life link to corresponding
URI, rather than a direct reference or link to the current URL of
publisher's response page. This is the r\^ole of the bibtex field {\tt doi}.
DOIs of papers can often be found through
\url{http://www.crossref.org/guestquery};\footnote{For papers that will appear
  in EPTCS and use \href{http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~rvg/EPTCS/eptcs.bst}
  {\tt $\backslash$bibliographystyle$\{$eptcs$\}$} there is no need to
  find DOIs on this website, as EPTCS will look them up for you
  automatically upon submission of a first version of your paper;
  these DOIs can then be incorporated in the final version, together
  with the remaining DOIs that need to found at DBLP or publisher's webpages.}
the second method {\it Search on article title}, only using the {\bf
surname} of the first-listed author, works best.  
Other places to find DOIs are DBLP and the response pages for cited
papers (maintained by their publishers).
{\bf EPTCS requires the inclusion of a DOI in each cited paper, when available.}

Often an official publication is only available against payment, but
as a courtesy to readers that do not wish to pay, the authors also
make the paper available free of charge at a repository such as
\url{arXiv.org}. In such a case it is recommended to also refer and
link to the URL of the response page of the paper in such a
repository.  This can be done using the bibtex fields {\tt ee} or {\tt
url}, which are treated as synonyms.  These fields should not be used
to duplicate information that is already provided through the DOI of
the paper.
You can find archival-quality URL's for most recently published papers
in DBLP---they are in the bibtex-field {\tt ee}. In fact, it is often
useful to check your references against DBLP records anyway, or just find
them there in the first place.

When using {\LaTeX} rather than {\tt pdflatex} to typeset your paper, by
default no linebreaking within long URLs is allowed. This leads often
to very ugly output, that moreover is different from the output
generated when using {\tt pdflatex}. This problem is repaired when
invoking \href{http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~rvg/EPTCS/breakurl.sty}
{\tt $\backslash$usepackage$\{$breakurl$\}$}: it allows linebreaking
within links and yield the same output as obtained by default with
{\tt pdflatex}. 
When invoking {\tt pdflatex}, the package {\tt breakurl} is ignored.
